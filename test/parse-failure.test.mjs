/**
 * The JSON parse failure helper, and the end-to-end path that uses it.
 *
 * V8 embeds the input in its own parse message, so interpolating
 * `error.message` walks file contents onto stdout past every redactor. The
 * ordering of the branches is the whole guard: a helper that looks for
 * `at position N` first finds that phrase INSIDE the quoted span whenever the
 * document itself contains it, and slices the document straight back out.
 * Nineteen of thirty-eight tools in this catalog shipped exactly that bug.
